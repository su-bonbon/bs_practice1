        Time and again, our friendship has been tested. I had lost all hope that I would lose such a dear friend, but you were the ones who held onto us because you believed that our friendship could overcome any barrier. Thank you for believing in us and for believing in me.
        I want you to know that having a fantastic friend like you is a blessing. Your friendship is more valuable than all the treasures in the universe. I could never have imagined how you could have touched my heart in so many different ways, and I will always cherish our friendship with everything I have in me. I adore you, my lovely friend.
        “It isn’t the red ribbon that binds us together. The root that unifies us does not derive from a tree on the wall. This bond knows no genetics. Friendship is a peculiar seed. No matter the season, the weather, nor the time of the day. When planted on a nourishing soul, it will always bear fruit.” – Clairel Estevez
        Friendship is a special bond that can help you sail through the most brutal storms of life. In you, my friend, I have found a support that’s unwavering and unconditional. No matter where we stay, I always know you are the one I can always count on. So, a big thank you to you for being my bosom buddy for life!
        I miss you when something good happens to me, and you aren’t there to share the moment. I miss when someone misunderstands me because you are the one who understands me the most. I miss you when I cry or laugh because you wipe my tears and make me laugh even more. I miss you always, but I miss you the most when I am alone, and I think about all the times we have spent with one another because I cherish those comforting memories always and forever in my heart.
        I adore you for everything you are, for all of our happy memories together, for our supportive interactions, and for all the ways you have helped me grow. I wouldn’t have it any other way because a friend like you is a rare diamond I dearly value. Love you, buddy. Words just can’t describe how much you mean to me.
        You came to me at the most unexpected time in my life, and I couldn’t thank you enough for that. You have laughed and cried with me. When everything was falling apart, you picked up the pieces and put them back together, I love you, my dearest friend. Thank you for being so caring, devoted and faithful. I want to let you know, you can always count on me, for I know, I can, too.
